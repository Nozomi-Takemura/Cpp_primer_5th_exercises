/*
Explain when operands are evaluated in the logical AND , logical
OR , and equality operators.

AND and OR are based on the so called short-circuit evaluation. This means that the evalution of the right operand of AND operator is done only if its left operand is TRUE. On the contrary, the right operand of the OR operator is done only if its left operand is FALSE.

Regarding equality operators, the operator is the left associative, and the operands are evaluated only if the returned value from each operator is TRUE.
