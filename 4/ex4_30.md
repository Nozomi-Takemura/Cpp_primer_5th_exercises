# 4_30
> parenthesize the following expressions to match the default evaluation:
- `sizeof x + y`
- `sizeof p->mem[i]`
- `sizeof a < b`
- `sizeof f()`

- `sizeof x + y`
    ```cpp
    sizeof(x)+y
    ```
    - Reason: the precedence of `size of` is higher than the one of `+`.
- `sizeof p->mem[i]`
    ```cpp
    sizeof(p->mem[i])
    ```
    - Reason: the precedences of member access `->` and subscript `[]` are higher than the one of `size of`.

- `sizeof a < b`
    ```cpp
    sizeof(a) < b
    ```
    - Reason: the precedences of `size of` is higher than the one of `<`.

- `sizeof f()`
    ```cpp
    sizeof(f())
    ```
    - Reason: the precedences of function call `()` is higher than the one of `size of`.
