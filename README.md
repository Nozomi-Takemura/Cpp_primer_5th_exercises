# This repository consists of my solutions to the exercises in the 5th edition of C++ Primer (5th edition.)

## Ex3_39: C-style char string vs char string
## Ex3_40: C-style char string concatenation (strcpy, strcat)
## Ex3_41: Inialization of a vector using an array
## Ex3_42: Inialization of a vector using an array
### Key: Vectors can be initilized by arrays but not vice versa
## Ex3_43: Access to elements of multidimensional arrays - pointers - subscripts - range for
### Key: Given arr of arr (2D arr) (= ptr to 1st arr in 1D), *(arr of arr) --> ptr to 1st arr in 2D --> *(ptr to 1st arr in 2D) --> 1st arr in 2D --auto-decay--> ptr to 1st arr in 2D.
### arr of arr of int --> e.g. int (*ptr)[] / int[] ---> *(int (*ptr)[]) = int[] 
## Ex3_44: Access to elements of multidimensional arrays - type alias
## Ex3_45: Access to elements of multidimensional arrays - type auto
