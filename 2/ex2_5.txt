Exercise 2.5: Determine the type of each of the following literals. Explain
the differences among the literals in each of the four examples:
(a) 'a', L'a', "a", L"a"
ANSWER:
- 'a' = literal of type char (the single character a)
- L'a' = literal of type wchar_t
- "a" = String literal (an array of two characters; a & null character)
- L"a" = String literal of type long char (array of wchar_t)

(b) 10, 10u, 10L, 10uL, 012, 0xC
- 10: signed decimal literals OR signed integer literals
- 10u: unsigned Integer literals
- 10L; signed Long literals
- 012: octral literals
- 0xc: hexadecimal literals

(c) 3.14, 3.14f, 3.14L
3.14: floating-point literal of type double
3.14f: floating-point literal of type float
3.14L: floating-point literal of type long double

(d) 10, 10u, 10., 10e-2
-10; signed decimal literals OR signed integer literals - type int
-10u: unsigned int
-10.: type: double becuase no suffix is added
-10e-2: type - double 


c++ output:
----
sieze of 10u: 4 10: 4 10.: 8 10e-2: 8 3.14: 8 3.14f: 4 3.14L: 16
