Q: To calculate a mortgage payment, what types would you use for the rate, principal, and payment? Explain why you selected each type.

A: I would use the followng types:
- rate: double,
- principal: double,
- payment: double.

Double is chose as type becuase the computational result on mortgage is important. Besides this, mortgage often related to a huge money; hence even with a slight change of the rate or payment caused by using smaller types instead of double, the impact is huge. Thus, double should be used.
