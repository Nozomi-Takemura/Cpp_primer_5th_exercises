No. The pointer stores address of an object. When a pointer is initilized, it should have 0; however, it has some value of address when it is not initilized, which cannot be differenciated from the pointer to which a valid object is correctly assigned.  
Ex.: 
0x7ffd204129a0 <-- no initialization
0x7ffd204128ac <-- after assignment
